> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working DevOps engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable scripts, and configs for the tools you reach for while building and operating systems. Use it as a shelf to grab a primer, verify a command, or borrow a concrete manifest that you can edit into your own. It is not a tutorial site and it does not try to replace each tool's official documentation.

## What's in here

The kit covers 22 tool families across cloud CLIs, configuration management, containers, orchestration, Git hosting, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, secrets management, observability, and security scanning. Most tool folders pair a primer with notes, scripts, configs, manifests, snippets, notebooks, Dockerfiles, or templates. Under `docs/concepts/`, eight foundational concept primers cover the ground the tool-specific material stands on — networking, Linux, scripting, version control, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, containerization, and observability.

## Quick links

- [Collector OTLP export config](otel/configs/2026-09-30-collector-otlp-export.yaml) — OTLP in on 4317/4318, one batch step, log out: the smallest pipeline that proves a span arrived.
- [OpenTelemetry quickstart trip-ups](otel/notes/2026-09-30-quickstart-trip-ups.md) — Sending gRPC to the HTTP port, getting the pipeline order wrong, and learning to read the log exporter's noisy output.
- [Instrumented Go HTTP server](otel/snippets/2026-09-30-instrumented-http-server.go) — One trace span per request plus a per-path request counter, so traces and metrics sit side by side.
- [Vault install and first secrets engine](vlt/scripts/2026-09-30-install-vault-and-first-secrets-engine.sh) — Dev server, a KV engine mounted at a custom path, one secret written and read back.
- [Grafana Cloud agent scrape config](grafc/configs/2026-09-30-minimal-metrics-scrape-config.yaml) — A first metrics pipeline: the unix exporter scraped every 15s and forwarded through a pass-through relabel rule.

## Status

Recently added: a minimal OpenTelemetry collector config that takes OTLP in and logs spans out, trip-ups from wiring a first span end to end, a tiny instrumented Go server pairing a trace with a counter, and a Vault script that mounts a KV engine at a custom path. Current work keeps strengthening production-ready patterns: private AKS, Helm chart validation, Ansible rollout safeguards, and environment promotion across Terraform, containers, and CI/CD.
