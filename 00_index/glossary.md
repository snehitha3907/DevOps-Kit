# Glossary

## Ansible

- **Control node** — The machine where Ansible is installed and from which commands and playbooks are run.
- **Inventory** — A file listing managed hosts and their groupings.
- **Playbook** — A YAML file defining a set of tasks to run on managed hosts.
- **Module** — A reusable unit of work Ansible executes (e.g., `apt`, `copy`, `service`).
- **Ad-hoc command** — A one-off Ansible command run directly without a playbook.
- **ansible-lint** — A linting tool that checks Ansible playbooks for syntax errors, best-practice violations, and idempotency risks.

## Docker

- **Image** — A read-only snapshot of a filesystem used as a template for creating containers.
- **Container** — A running instance of an image; encapsulates an app and its dependencies in an isolated environment.
- **Dockerfile** — A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Layer** — A cached build step in a Docker image that enables incremental builds.
- **Registry** — A storage and distribution system for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).
- **Volume** — Persistent storage that survives container restarts.
- **Port mapping** — A Docker networking feature mapping a host port to a container port.
- **Compose** — A tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a YAML file.
- **Build context** — The directory path passed to `docker build` that the Docker daemon uses as the source for copying files during image creation.

## Git

- **Repository (repo)** — A directory Git watches, containing all tracked files and their full change history.
- **Commit** — A snapshot of files at a point in time, identified by a unique hash.
- **Stage (index)** — An intermediate area where changes are prepared before committing.
- **Branch** — A separate line of development; the default branch is named `main`.
- **Clone** — Copying a remote repository to the local machine.
- **Push** — Sending local commits to a remote repository.
- **Pull** — Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.
- **Merge** — Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Diff** — A view showing what changed between two commits or between working files and the last commit.
- **Remote** — A URL pointing to another copy of the repository, typically hosted remotely.
- **HEAD** — A pointer to the commit currently checked out.
- **Rebase** — Rewriting commit history by applying commits from one branch onto another.
- **Git worktree** — A mechanism that allows multiple working directories to be associated with a single repository, enabling parallel work on different branches without stashing or switching.
- **Hook** — A script Git executes before or after a specific event (e.g., pre-commit, commit-msg, post-checkout).
- **Pre-commit hook** — A Git hook that runs before a commit is finalised, used to check for issues like trailing whitespace, conflict markers, or debug statements.
- **Commit-msg hook** — A Git hook that validates the format of a commit message, often enforcing conventional commit standards.
- **Post-checkout hook** — A Git hook that runs after a branch switch, used to maintain hooks, suggest cleanup, or display context.
- **Conventional commit** — A commit message format that follows a structured prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) enabling automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

## GitHub

- **Repository** — A project container with code, issues, pull requests, and wiki.
- **Pull Request (PR)** — A proposed change that can be reviewed and merged.
- **Issue** — A discussion thread for bugs, features, or tasks.
- **Fork** — A personal copy of a repository for contributing changes.
- **Wiki** — A built-in documentation space for a repository.
- **Projects** — A kanban-style project management board for tracking work.
- **Insights** — Analytics and metrics for a repository, including traffic, contributors, and dependency graph.
- **GitHub flow** — A lightweight branching workflow where feature branches are created from `main`, changes are committed, a pull request is opened, and the branch is merged and deleted after review.

## GitLab CI

- **Pipeline** — A collection of jobs split into stages (e.g., build → test → deploy) defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- **Job** — A single unit of work in a pipeline, with a script, image, and optional rules.
- **Stage** — A group of jobs that run in parallel within the same pipeline stage.
- **Runner** — A process that executes GitLab CI jobs; can be shared (GitLab-provided) or self-hosted.
- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** — The YAML file at the root of a repository that defines the pipeline configuration.
- **Artifact** — Files produced by a job (e.g., binary, test report) passed to later stages or downloadable from the UI.
- **CI/CD variable** — A key-value pair used for secrets, API tokens, and configuration in GitLab CI/CD.

## Kubernetes

- **Pod** — The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes; one or more containers sharing storage and network.
- **Deployment** — A controller that manages a set of identical pods, handling scaling and rolling updates.
- **Service** — A stable network endpoint for accessing a set of pods.
- **Manifest** — A YAML or JSON file defining a Kubernetes resource.
- **kubectl** — The Kubernetes CLI tool for interacting with clusters.
- **kind** — A tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes.
- **Minikube** — A tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for development and testing.
- **NodePort** — A Kubernetes Service type that exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP address.
- **ReplicaSet** — A Kubernetes controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- **Rolling update** — A deployment strategy that gradually replaces old pod instances with new ones, minimizing downtime.
- **ConfigMap** — A Kubernetes resource for storing non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs that can be consumed by pods.
- **Secret** — A Kubernetes resource for storing sensitive data such as passwords or API keys, encoded as base64.

## Terraform

- **Provider** — A plugin that lets Terraform manage a specific infrastructure platform (e.g., AWS, local).
- **State** — A file that maps real-world resources to your Terraform configuration.
- **Plan** — A dry-run that shows what changes Terraform will make.
- **Apply** — The command that executes the changes shown in a plan.
- **Resource** — A declarative description of an infrastructure component (e.g., `local_file`).
